## Test Commands

You can test the ares-cli commands and their options to check their validity. The test is performed by `jasmine` or `npm test`. 

### Before You Begin

1. Turn on the webOS device.
2. Check the IP address and SSH port number.
3. Enable the developer mode.
    - webOS OSE: Already enabled by default.
    - webOS Auto: Enable it in the Settings app.

The following key-value pairs are the default configurations for the test.

| Key    | Value     |
|--------|-----------|
| device | emulator  |
| ip     | 127.0.0.1 |
| port   | 6622      |

### Test Usages

- Test with default configurations.
    
    ``` shell
    $ jasmine
    ```
    
    or

    ``` shell
    $ jasmine device=emulator, ip=127.0.0.1, port=6622
    ```

- Test with specific configurations. (It can be omitted when using port 22.)

    ``` shell
    $ jasmine --device=webOS --ip=192.168.0.12
    ```

- Test with specific port configurations.

    ``` shell
    $ jasmine --device=webOS --ip=192.168.0.12 --port=24
    ```

- Test ares-generate command.

    ``` shell
    $ jasmine --device=webOS --ip=192.168.0.12 --port=24 spec/jsSpec/ares-generate.js
    ```

- Test using npm command `npm test` instead of `jasmine`.

    ``` shell
    $ npm test --device=webOS --ip=192.168.0.12 --port=24
    ```

so it is hard to add other options to the command (such as capture)
- Rename ares-device-info.js to ares-device.js
- Add --system-info and --session-info options
- Update ares-device TC

:Testing Performed:
1. All unit test passed
2. ESLint done
3. Check the below commands
   $ ares-device
   $ ares-device --system-info
   $ ares-device --session-info

:Issues Addressed:
